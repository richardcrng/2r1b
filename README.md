[**Two Rooms and a Boom**](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/tworoomsandaboom) is a social game of hidden roles and deduction, involving players split into two different _physical_ rooms.

It is for **6-30 players**, and games take **as little as 10 minutes**.

This repo is is a (work-in-progress) web app implementation of it, as a replacement for the card set if you don't have immediate access. (You should buy the physical set, though - it's fun!)

_Note: you will still need to be with a group of players in-person._
